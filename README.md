# Project step 5: Communication

## Preparation

1. Reflect on the entire research process you have developed.
2. Review your research question, data preparation strategy, and analysis plan to identify the potential significance of your planned research.
3. Review the concepts and strategies for communicating research ([Chapter 11, Public facing](https://qtalr.github.io/book/part_5/11_contribute.html#sec-contribute-public-facing) and [slides](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-24.html#/)).

## Objectives

- Apply the concepts and strategies for communicating research to public audiences.
- Develop and share a presentation that outlines your planned research.
- Reflect on the feedback you receive from your peers and instructor and finalize your research plan (prospectus).

## Instructions

### Getting started

*Make sure that you have forked and cloned the [`project_web`](https://github.com/lin-380-s24/project_web) repository from GitHub and that your Git and GitHub configuration is set up on your computer. See [recipe](https://qtalr.github.io/qtalrkit/articles/recipe-4.html#check-your-understanding) and slides [Scaffolding research](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-10.html#/) and [Project orientation](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/slides/day-11.html#/) for guidance.*

1. Open your research project repository in RStudio.
2. Open and modify the `reports/prospectus.qmd` as necessary to complete the steps below.

*Remember to use the edit, add, commit, push workflow to update your GitHub page.*

### Brainstorming presentation

- Identify the central theme of your planned research: Consider the research question, data preparation strategy, and analysis plan you have developed. What is the potential significance of your planned research? How might it contribute to the field or area? What are the key takeaways you want your audience to understand?
- Consider the audience: Who is your audience? What are their interests and needs? What are the key messages you want to convey to your audience? What do you want from your audience (feedback, support, collaboration, *etc.*)?
- Develop a presentation outline: What are the key sections of your presentation? What are the key points you want to make in each section? What visual aids will you use to support your points?

### Draft a presentation


### Brainstorming prospectus revision

- Reflect on the feedback you have received from your peers and instructor on your presentation. What were the key takeaways from the feedback? What suggestions or recommendations were made? How will you incorporate the feedback into your research plan (prospectus)?
- Consider and incorporate the feedback into your research plan (prospectus). Is there anything you need to revise or update based on the feedback you received? Is the scope of your research clear and well-defined? Or too broad or too narrow? Are your research question, data preparation strategy, and analysis plan well-aligned and well-articulated? Do you have sufficient detail to guide your research?
- Develop a plan for finalizing your research plan (prospectus). What steps do you need to take to complete your research plan? What resources or support do you need to finalize your research plan?

### Finalize your research plan (prospectus)

1. Reflect on your answers to the brainstorming questions above and finalize your research plan (prospectus) based on the feedback you have received throughout the process. Make sure to [include the sections outlined in syllabus](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/#tbl-prospectus-template).
2. Remember: this activity provides an opportunity to demonstrate your skills in quantitative text analysis and its application to language science research. These align with the [course learning outcomes](https://lin-380-s24.github.io/#learning-outcomes).
   * To demonstrate your skills you do not have to have a perfect research plan, but you should have a well-considered and well-articulated plan that demonstrates your understanding of the research process and your ability to apply quantitative text analysis to language science research.

## Assessing your progress

1. Reflect on the process of communicating research.

- What did you learn?
- What did you find most/ least challenging?
- What resources did you consult?

2. Consider how your prospectus turned out.

- Did your interests evolved?
- Did your research questions and objectives evolved?
- What factors influenced these changes?

## Submission

1. Use the necessary Quarto features to format your document (*e.g.*, headings, lists, links, citations, *etc.*).
2. Render your project (to HTML).
3. Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
4. Create an Issue or Discussion post in your repository to share your progress and ask questions. Tag the instructor `@francojc` in your post.
